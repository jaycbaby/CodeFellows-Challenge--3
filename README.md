CodeFellows-Challenge: Backbone.js address book
========================
Generating a Backbone.js app that allows a user to create, edit, update, and destroy (delete) users. Users should have first name, last name, and email address fields. 

Learning Backbone without a solid foundation of Javascript was initially very difficult. Spent about a week all of my free time trying to learning how MV/C frameworks work... Stackoverflow & Google to the rescue!!
